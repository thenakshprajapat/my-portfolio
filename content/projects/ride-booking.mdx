A simulation of a basic ride booking system similar to Ola or Uber, built using Object-Oriented Programming.  
The system includes:
- **User class:** represents riders who can request trips  
- **Driver class:** represents drivers with vehicle details  
- **RideManager:** handles trip assignments and fare calculations  

**Concepts Used:** `OOP`, `inheritance`, `method overriding`, `encapsulation`.

**Highlight:** Demonstrates clean architecture and practical OOP principles.
