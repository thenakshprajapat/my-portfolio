A simple Python project that lets users maintain two sets â€” one for watched movies and another for unwatched ones.  
Users can:
- Add movies to lists  
- Move a movie from unwatched to watched  
- Display current watchlist  

**Concepts Used:** `sets`, `loops`, `membership testing`, `input handling`.
