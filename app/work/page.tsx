  description:
    "Hypothesis: Can a complete beginner learn computer science faster if the internet clutter is removed and only the best curated resources remain? Experiment: Built a structured learning hub with categorized links, starter roadmaps, and clean UI to reduce friction and overwhelm. Result: Early testers reported spending less time searching and more time learning. Learned that simplicity isn't basic — it's leverage.",

  title: "Portfolio for Rohit",
  description:
    "Hypothesis: Can a personal portfolio feel more like a living identity than a PDF on the web? Experiment: Designed and developed a clean, responsive portfolio showcasing Rohit's skills, projects, and story using a minimal, distraction-free layout and reusable components. Result: He now has a professional online presence that speaks for him — even when he isn’t there. Learned that building for others requires listening more than coding.",

  title: "Paper Analyzer",
  description:
    "Hypothesis: Can students predict important exam topics by analyzing past question papers instead of blindly guessing? Experiment: Built a tool that ingests question papers, extracts questions, groups them by topics, and highlights the most frequently asked areas so students know what actually matters. Result: Made it easier to spot high-weightage chapters and patterns across years. Learned that good exam prep isn’t about studying everything — it’s about studying what repeats.",
